# Speech-to-text apps: Microsoft vs Google - which is the best for dictation?
Microsoft and Google are major players in developing voice to text apps. Microsoft Azure Speech Service and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text are leading platforms for voice typing, transcription, and productivity. In this guide, we’ll compare the Microsoft and Google speech-to-text apps to help us decide.

## Features
Microsoft Azure Speech Service and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text overlap if we need basic audio transcription. But for more advanced voice dictation applications, the two platforms have different strengths. 

**Google’s** software stands out for its multi-language support. Speech-to-Text is capable of transcribing audio in any of 120 languages to text. By comparison, Microsoft’s speech to text software only supports 29 languages at this time. Google’s platform will even automatically detect the language of the recording and will recognize proper nouns so that we don’t have to worry about formatting and capitalization later on.

**Microsoft Azure Speech Service** is more feature-rich when it comes to getting transcription exactly right. we can feed the software a custom speech model to help us improve accuracy for a single speaker or for speakers with a regional accent. Or, Speech Service supports acoustic models that we can use to cancel out noise in our recordings. This is especially helpful if we frequently experience audio noise in a conference room or over a headset.

Both Microsoft and Googles’ platforms automatically detect when there are multiple speakers in a recording. So, we can easily use either of these speech-to-text apps for transcribing meetings and conference calls.


## Performance

For straightforward audio transcription, Microsoft Azure Speech Service tends to perform better than Google Cloud Speech-to-Text. The difference is that Microsoft’s software uses AI to make sure that what it’s transcribing makes linguistic sense. Since this software can accept custom speech models, it also handles accents, lisps, and other speech impediments significantly better than Google’s Speech-to-Text platform.

Google largely sticks to recognizing words based on their audio signatures and stringing them together. This means that when the software is struggling with audio quality or interpreting an accent, the transcription quality can suffer quite a bit.

All that said, getting better results from Microsoft’s software is dependent on using high-quality speech and acoustic models. If we skip this step, we may find that the two platforms are much more comparable in their accuracy when transcribing difficult recordings. Feeding Speech Service poor models can also hurt transcription and leave with a less accurate result.

We found that the two apps are also very comparable when it comes to recognizing multiple speakers. This feature isn’t always perfectly accurate if we have two people with a similar tone and a less than crisp recording. But most of the time, both Speech Service and Speech-to-Text were each able to differentiate speakers on a conference call within the transcribed text.

## Pricing and plans
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text pricing is based on usage, including the duration of audio processed (in seconds).

Azure Speech to Text pricing is based on the number of speech units consumed.

# Speech-to-Text APIs

At its core, a speech-to-text (also known as automatic speech recognition, or ASR) application programming interface (API) is simply the ability to call a service to transcribe audio containing speech into written text. The STT service will take the provided audio data, process it using either machine learning or legacy techniques (e.g. Hidden Markov Models), and then provide a transcript of what it has inferred was said.

## Things to consider when choosing a speech-to-text API
There are a number of aspects to carefully consider in the evaluation and selection of a transcription service and the order of importance is dependent on your target use case and end user needs.

1. Accuracy 
2. Speed
3. Cost 
4. Modality
    - Batch or pre-recorded transcription capabilities 
    - Real-time streaming 
5. Features & Capabilities 
6. Scalability and Reliability 
7. Customization, Flexibility, and Adaptability
8. Ease of Adoption and Use 
9. Support and Subject Matter Expertise

## Important features:
The key features that are offered by each API differ, and your use cases will dictate your priorities and needs in terms of which features to focus on.

1. Multi-language support 
2. Formatting 
    - Automatic punctuation & capitalization 
    - Profanity filtering or redaction
3. Understanding 
    - Topic detection 
    - Intent detection 
    - Sentiment analysis
    - Summarization 
4. Keywords (a.k.a. Keyword Boosting) 
5. Custom models 
6. Accepts multiple audio formats

## Speech-to-text use cases:
As noted at the outset, voice technology that's built on the back of STT APIs is a critical part of the future of business. So what are some of the most common use cases for speech-to-text APIs? Let's take a look.

- Smart assistants - Smart assistants like Siri and Alexa are perhaps the most frequently encountered use case for speech-to-text, taking spoken commands, converting them to text, and then acting on them.

- Conversational AI - Voicebots let humans speak and, in real time, get answers from an AI. Converting speech to text is the first step in this process, and it has to happen quickly for the interaction to truly feel like a conversation.

- Sales and support enablement - Sales and support digital assistants that provide tips, hints, and solutions to agents by transcribing, analyzing and pulling up information in real time. It can also be used to gauge sales pitches or sales calls with a customer.

- Contact centers - Contact centers can use STT to create transcripts of their calls, providing more ways to evaluate their agents, understand what customers are asking about, and provide insight into different aspects of their business that are typically hard to assess.

- Speech analytics - Broadly speaking, speech analytics is any attempt to process spoken audio to extract insights. This might be done in a call center, as above, but it could also be done in other environments, like meetings or even speeches and talks.

- Accessibility - Providing transcriptions of spoken speech can be a huge win for accessibility, whether it's providing captions for classroom lectures or creating badges that transcribe speech on the fly.
